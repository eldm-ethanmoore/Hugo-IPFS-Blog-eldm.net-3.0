# [GracefulJourney](https://gracefuljourney.xyz/)

For the last 4 years I have been working on my magnum opus [Graceful Journey](https://gracefuljourney.xyz/).
I thought it would be interesting to start from the ground up in lore building by creating an english equivalent alphanumeric set of hieroglyphics.
The reason I chose hieroglyphics is because I felt that symbols could act as defacto key symbols on a map. 
Another reason is that the hieroglyphic style could work is for fantasy or sci-fi dominant scenes via serif and sans-serif font variants.

Graceful Journey contains alot of large scale conflicts that a more defined font face could help illustrate.
The current Relic mock up is called glyph and it is a serif font face that does not include ligatures or kerning.
The next iterations will include antique and modern which will include sans-serif, numerous ligatures, and kerning!

# Chrome Extension

I am releasing a chrome extension as a dictionary for reading Relic and its derivatives.

# Current Blog Site Purpose?

Since most of my work will be on a different site updates should be expected on gracefuljourney.xyz
The current blog site will be used for different important milestones like 3d modeling, teasers, or lore creations.

# Next steps?

When this post is pushed gracefuljourney.xyz should be showing a new albeit simple page.
A public github repo has been made for new documentation and the current ttf file.
By the end of next week the chrome extension will be finished, in review, and public.
After the extension is public gracefuljourney.xyz will be worked on as a fan page for gj.

## Thank You for Reading!
