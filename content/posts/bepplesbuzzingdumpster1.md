# Bepples Buzzing Dumpster #1?

----------------------------------------

## Yup..! Im starting up a *real blog* instead of just using this as a **portfolio website**.

> ***Bepples Buzzing Dumpster is the name of my loud desktop.***

> ***Bepples is also a fun name***

The #1 is the first issue of my triumphs and tribulations in working with whatever I need to get Graceful Journey "***Done***".

> Whatever Done Means
> > *As a Game, an Animation, or a Cartographic Stimulus.*

I probably won't do a newsletter because the blog theme is so clean that just 1 minute of staring may induce bliss.

----------------------------------------

# [GracefulJourney.xyz](https://www.gracefuljourney.xyz)

The current state of the website is abysmal, however, im working on a new implementation. 

> ***Relic Extension ?***

*Yeah...* Im not going to finish that. Relic is just a font face so you can just right click on highlighted text and get the word from your browsers right-click menu.

> ***Relic Serif?***

Yes! Thats almost done. Right now im working on the kerning or the space between glyphs. I also did a slight reworking on the sans serif variant but that hasnt been pushed to the Relic github repo. After the serif font face gets done the website will be my main focus.

> The current state of the website is ***abysmal***..

Thats good.
The new iteration will be *theeeeee* ***graceful journey home.***

My main issue right now is integrating firebase into my stack and accepting that Moralis doesn't offer a db instance.

It's being written in React Typescript (Client only) but I will probably have to move towards SSR and NextJs.

The good part is that the transition shouldnt be too bad because the structure, styling, and behavior is probably compatible.

The styling is fairly simple with plain css but I will hopefully move towards a UI kit.

# It will be web3 only for registration. 

I know most people don't like this but I dont care. Its just more interesting and probably better. 

Im hoping I can get some cool stuff going on a solidity contract.

----------------------------------------

# The First *Real* Project.

I know I haven't been *really* working on graceful journey and that my first steps are really housekeeping duties. Getting eldm.net blog started, graceful journey domain updated, and figuring out where to put time and effort into. But I can say that things are getting moving.

By next week the serif font face for Relic should be done. Graceful Journey V2 should be around 80% done. Im going to try and not be super ambitious but instead try to get as many neat features as I can.
