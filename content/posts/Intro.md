# Intro

I am proficient in ████, Py████, Javascript, and Solidity. I have experience in Bash, ████, C++/C#, and Rust. I also have experience in HTML/JSX, CSS, Markdown, YAML, and LATEX. I hope to continue to learn Haskell, █████, and nix expressions in the future.

I am interested in blockchain economics and smart contract development. I am also interested in furthering my knowledge of blockchain parsers, edge computing, and real project management. I enjoy shell scripting, customizing my environment, and automating mundane routines ( Check out my ScriptAndConfigs github repo. ).

My ambitions include keeping this website and my repositories up to date. Furthering my education to graduation. Specialize deeper into smart contracts, blockchain related technologies, and continue to learn more about general computer science concepts.
