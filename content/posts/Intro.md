# Intro

I am a computer science student currently attending Western Kentucky University. This is my blog site that contains all aspects of my academic, professional, and personal pursuits.

I am proficient in Java and Python. I have experience in Bash, Ruby, C++/C#/C, Javascript, and Solidity. I also have experience in HTML, CSS, Markdown, YAML, XML and LATEX. I hope to continue to learn Haskell and Scheme in the future.

I am heavily interested in blockchain architecture and smart contract development. I am also interested in furthering my knowledge of programming languages and designing programs with their different attributes in mind. I enjoy shell scripting, customizing my environment, and automating mundane routines ( Check out my ScriptAndConfigs github repo! ).

My ambitions include keeping this website and my repositories up to date. Furthering my education to graduation. Specialize deeper into smart contracts, blockchain related technologies, and continue to learn more about general computer science concepts.
